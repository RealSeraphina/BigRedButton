# Big Red Button

BRB automates NMAP, NIKTO, DIRB,and SEARCHSPLOIT scans. 

When attacking a target we need to run a suite of scans and use that information to search for potential exploits. 
Big Red Button (BRB) seeks to automate this process.  After providing BRB with the target IP address the system will 
automatically execute an NMAP, NIKTO, DIRB,and SEARCHSPLOIT scan generating a report for each.
